        <h2>Problem statement: Easily Browseable Sports Channels</h2>
        <p>
        Sport lovers need a easier way to determine which games will be on their location TV channels or a way to see how they can watch their wanted game if it is not playing in their location.

      <p>
          In our affinity diagram we defined who our target audience is, how we are going to solve the problem that we plan to tackle, and the problems we may face along the way.
       Our main audience is fans of various sports and the way we are going to tackle our problem is by creating both an app and a website to easily browse active games and what channels they are on.
       Some of the biggest problems we face are not having all the sports that people may want to watch and problems with regional broadcasting/ local sports.
